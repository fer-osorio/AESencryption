# AESencryption

A modular C/C++ library for AES-based file encryption with integrated statistical quality analysis.

## Overview

AESencryption provides both a robust encryption library and a framework for building file-encryption applications. What sets it apart is its built-in capability to measure encryption quality through statistical methods, ensuring your encrypted data exhibits proper randomness characteristics.

**Key Features:**
- AES encryption (128/192/256-bit keys) with ECB and CBC modes
- File format handlers (BMP, text, extensible to others)
- Statistical analysis of encryption quality
- C library core with C++ wrapper classes
- Command-line tools for immediate use

## Quick Start

### Building the Project

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd AESencryption

# Build all components
make

# Build specific components
make data-encryption  # Core AES implementation (C)
make core            # C++ wrapper classes
make file-handlers   # File format support
make tests           # Test suite
```

**Requirements:**
- GCC or Clang with C11/C++17 support
- GNU Make
- Linux (primary), cross-platform support in progress

### Encrypting Your First File

```bash
# Using the command-line tool (after building)
bin/command-line-tools/image-encryption/bmp_encryptor --encrypt --key <keyfile> --input <file> --output <file>

# If the key file it doesn't exist, an exception is thrown asking to create a key first
```

### Using as a Library (C++)

```cpp
#include "cipher.hpp"
#include "key.hpp"

using namespace AESencryption;

// Create a 256-bit key
Key key(Key::LengthBits::_256);

// Create cipher with CBC mode
Cipher cipher(key, Cipher::OperationMode::Identifier::CBC);

// Encrypt data
std::vector<uint8_t> plaintext = /* your data */;
std::vector<uint8_t> ciphertext;
cipher.encryption(plaintext, ciphertext);

// Save key for later use
key.save("mykey.bin");
```

## Architecture Highlights

### Modular Design
- **C core** (`data-encryption`): Pure AES implementation, no dependencies
- **C++ wrapper** (`src/core`): Object-oriented interface with RAII guarantees
- **Extensibility**: Implement `Encryptor` interface to support new encryption schemes
- **File handlers**: Abstract `FileBase` class for format-specific encryption

### Encryption Quality Analysis
The `metrics-analysis` module measures randomness properties of encrypted data:
- Statistical distribution tests
- Entropy calculations
- Pattern detection

This helps verify that your encryption produces properly randomized output.

### Module Documentation
Each module contains its own README with specific usage instructions:
- `data-encryption/README.md` - Core AES algorithm details
- `file-handlers/README.md` - Supported formats and extending handlers
- `metrics-analysis/README.md` - Statistical methods and interpretation

## Testing

```bash
# Build and run all tests
make tests
./bin/test_runner

./bin/test_runner --system
```

The test suite includes:
- **Unit tests**: Individual component validation
- **Integration tests**: Module interaction verification
- **System tests**: End-to-end workflow testing
- **NIST test vectors**: Compliance with FIPS 197 and SP 800-38A standards

## Examples

### Encrypting a Bitmap Image

```bash
# Encrypt
./bin/bmp_encryptor encrypt photo.bmp encrypted.bmp key.bin

# Decrypt
./bin/bmp_encryptor decrypt encrypted.bmp decrypted.bmp key.bin

# Verify they match
diff photo.bmp decrypted.bmp
```

### Custom Cipher Configuration

```cpp
#include "cipher.hpp"
#include "key.hpp"
#include <vector>

using namespace AESencryption;

// Load existing key from file
Key key("saved_key.bin");

// Create cipher with specific operation mode
Cipher cipher(key, Cipher::OperationMode::Identifier::CBC);

// Set custom initialization vector for CBC
std::vector<uint8_t> iv = {/* 16 bytes */};
cipher.setInitialVectorForTesting(iv);  // Production API coming soon

// Use cipher for encryption
std::vector<uint8_t> data = /* ... */;
std::vector<uint8_t> encrypted;
cipher.encryption(data, encrypted);
```
